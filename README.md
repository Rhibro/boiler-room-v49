 <h2>Project Summary: GitHub Repository Viewer</h2>
 
This project is a web-based application built with TypeScript that fetches and displays repository information from the GitHub API for a specific user (Me!). 
The main functionality includes:

Fetching Data: Uses fetch to retrieve repository data from the GitHub API and parses the response into a strongly-typed Repo interface.

Dynamic UI Updates: Displays a clickable list of repositories. When a repository is clicked, detailed information such as its description, programming language, and URL is shown dynamically.

Error Handling: Implements robust error handling using try/catch to manage fetch failures gracefully, displaying user-friendly error messages in the UI if issues arise.

TypeScript Features: Utilizes TypeScript interfaces, type annotations, and strict null checks to ensure type safety and prevent runtime errors.

User Experience: Enhances interactivity with event listeners and provides fallback messages for missing or incomplete data.

This project showcases the integration of TypeScript into a simple yet functional web application, emphasizing type safety, error handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
